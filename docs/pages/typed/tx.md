# Transactions

Preparing, signing, and broadcasting extrinsics is one of the main purposes of `polkadot-api`. There are two ways to create transactions in PAPI, and will see both of them in this page.

## `tx.Pallet.Call`

In order to create a transaction directly in PAPI (without a pre-made call data) use the object `typedApi.tx`. Every `typedApi.tx.Pallet.Call` available in the chain has the following structure:

```ts
interface TxEntry<Arg> {
  (data: Arg): Transaction
  isCompatible: IsCompatible
  getCompatibilityLevel: GetCompatibilityLevel
}
```

[We already know how `isCompatible` and `getCompatibilityLevel` works](/typed#getcompatibilitylevel). In order to get a `Transaction` object, we need to pass all arguments required by the extrinsic. Let's see two examples, `Balances.transfer_keep_alive` and `NominationPools.claim_payout`.

The case of `claim_payout` is the simplest one, since it doesn't take any arguments. Simply as

```ts
const tx: Transaction = typedApi.tx.NominationPools.claim_payout()
```

would do the trick. Let's see the other one, that takes arguments:

```ts
// MultiAddress is a first class citizen, and there's a special type for it
import { MultiAddress } from "@polkadot-api/descriptors"

const tx: Transaction = typedApi.tx.Balances.transfer_keep_alive({
  // these args are strongly typed!
  dest: MultiAddress.Id("destAddressInSS58Format"),
  value: 10n ** 10n, // 1 DOT
})
```

## `txFromCallData`

This option will just take a `Binary` call data and pack the transaction from it. It will validate the input when creating it, throwing an error otherwise. It will create the transaction asynchronously if you just pass the call data, and synchronously if you pass an already awaited compatibility token!

Its interface is:

```ts
interface TxFromBinary {
  (callData: Binary): Promise<Transaction>
  (callData: Binary, compatibilityToken: CompatibilityToken): Transaction
}
```

Very simple. Let's see it with an example:

```ts
const callData = Binary.fromHex("0x00002c50415049203c3320444f54")

// without compatibility token it's a promise
const tx: Transaction = await api.txFromCallData(callData)

const token = await api.compatibilityToken
// with token is sync!
const txSync: Transaction = api.txFromCallData(callData, token)
```

## `Transaction` type

Both methods of creating transactions in PAPI output a `Transaction` type, that has the following interface:

```ts
type Transaction = {
  sign: TxSignFn
  signSubmitAndWatch: TxObservable
  signAndSubmit: TxPromise
  getEncodedData: TxCall
  getEstimatedFees: (
    from: Uint8Array | SS58String,
    txOptions?: TxOptions,
  ) => Promise<bigint>
  decodedCall: Enum
}
```

We will see item by item its content.

### `decodedCall`

The `decodedCall` field holds the `papi` way of expressing an extrinsic, decoded in an `Enum` type. It could be useful to pass it as call data to a `proxy.proxy` call, for example, that takes another call as a parameter:

```ts
import { MultiAddress } from "@polkadot-api/descriptors"

const tx: Transaction = typedApi.tx.Balances.transfer_keep_alive({
  dest: MultiAddress.Id("destAddressInSS58Format"),
  value: 10n ** 10n, // 1 DOT
})

const proxyTx = typedApi.tx.Proxy.proxy({
  real: MultiAddress.Id("proxyAddressInSS58Format"),
  call: tx.decodedCall,
  force_proxy_type: undefined,
})
```

### `getEncodedData`

`getEncodedData`, instead, packs the call data (without signed extensions, of course!) as a SCALE-encoded blob. It also runs the compatibility check, so it needs the runtime and descriptors loaded. As we've seen with `getCompatibilityLevel`, if you call it directly it'll be a `Promise`-based call, or you can pass in a `compatibilityToken` you've previously awaited for and it'll answer synchronously. Let's see an example:

```ts
// `getEncodedData` has this interface
interface TxCall {
  (): Promise<Binary>
  (compatibilityToken: CompatibilityToken): Binary
}

import { MultiAddress } from "@polkadot-api/descriptors"

const tx: Transaction = typedApi.tx.Balances.transfer_keep_alive({
  dest: MultiAddress.Id("destAddressInSS58Format"),
  value: 10n ** 10n, // 1 DOT
})

// without argument it's async!
const encodedTx = await tx.getEncodedData()

// with compatibilityToken argument it's sync!
const compatibilityToken = await typedApi.compatibilityToken
const encodedTx = tx.getEncodedData(compatibilityToken)
```

### `TxOptions`

All the methods that will follow sign the transaction (or fake-sign in the case of `getEncodedFees`). When signing a transaction, some optional `TxOptions` could be passed. Every one of them as a default, so it's not needed to pass them. Let's see and discuss them one by one:

```ts
type TxOptions<Asset> = Partial<{
  at: HexString | "best" | "finalized"
  tip: bigint
  mortality: { mortal: false } | { mortal: true; period: number }
  asset: Asset
  nonce: number
  customSignedExtensions: Record<
    string,
    {
      value?: any
      additionalSigned?: any
    }
  >
}>
```

- `at`: gives the option to choose which block to target when creating the transaction. Default: `finalized`
- `mortality`: gives the option to choose the mortality for the transaction. Default: `{ mortal: true, period: 64 }`
- `nonce`: this is meant for advanced users that submit several transactions in a row, it allows to modify the default `nonce`. Default: highest nonce found in any known block.
- `tip`: add tip to transaction. Default: `0`
- `asset`: there're several chains that allow you to choose which asset to use to pay for the fees and tip. This field will be strongly typed as well and will adapt to every chain used in the `dApp`. Default: `undefined`. This means to use the native token from the chain.
- `customSignedExtensions`: gives the option to define the value of "custom" signed extensions, understood as signed extensions that PAPI is not aware of. One can define either one of `value` or `additionalSigned`, or both of them. Their type should be either SCALE-encoded `Uint8Array` or the JS type that PAPI's dynamic codecs infer. The default behaviour for unknown signed extensions is to throw an error, unless the type of it is an `Option`, in that case the default is `None`.

### `getEstimatedFees`

With `getEstimatedFees` we make a call to the runtime and check how much would it cost to run a specific transaction. We need the address of the sender (or public key) and the `TxOptions` to construct a fake-signed transaction. We'll check the fees against the latest known `finalizedBlock`. Its interface is as follows:

```ts
type TxEstimateFees = (
  from: Uint8Array | SS58String,
  txOptions?: TxOptions<Asset>,
) => Promise<bigint>
```

### `sign`

As simple as it seems, this method packs the transaction, sends it to the signer, and receives the signature. It requires a [`PolkadotSigner`](/signers), we saw them in another section of the docs. Let's see its interface:

```ts
type TxSignFn = (
  from: PolkadotSigner,
  txOptions?: TxOptions,
) => Promise<HexString>
```

It'll get back the whole `SignedExtrinsic` that needs to be broadcasted. If the signer fails (or the user cancels the signature) it'll throw an error.

### `signAndSubmit`

`signAndSubmit` will sign (exactly the same way as `sign`). After signing it will validate the transaction against the block specified in `txOptions` and broadcast the transaction if it is valid. If it is not it will throw an [`InvalidTxError`](#invalidtxerror).

- The promise will resolve as soon as the transaction is found in a finalized block.
- The promise will reject if the transaction is invalid at any finalized block after broadcasting. It will throw as well an [`InvalidTxError`](#invalidtxerror).

Note that this promise is not abortable. Let's see the interface:

```ts
type TxPromise = (
  from: PolkadotSigner,
  txOptions?: TxOptions,
) => Promise<TxFinalized>

type TxFinalized = {
  txHash: HexString
  ok: boolean
  events: Array<SystemEvent["event"]>
  dispatchError?: DispatchError
  block: { hash: string; number: number; index: number }
}
```

You get the `txHash`; the bunch of `events` that this extrinsic emitted (see [this section](/typed/events) to see what to do with them); `ok` which simply tells if the extrinsic was successful (i.e. event `System.ExtrinsicSuccess` is found), with its [`dispatchError`](#dispatcherror) and the `block` information where the tx is found.

### `signSubmitAndWatch`

`signSubmitAndWatch` is the Observable-based version of `signAndSubmit`. The function returns an Observable and will emit a bunch of events giving information about the status of transaction in the chain, until it'll be eventually finalized or definitely invalid. Let's see its interface:

:::warning
The Observable is single cast, and it's not stateful. The transaction will be sent to signature, broadcasted, etc on every single subscription individually. If you want to share the subscription, you could craft an observable using `shareLatest`.
:::

```ts
export type TxObservable = (
  from: PolkadotSigner,
  txOptions?: TxOptions,
) => Observable<TxEvent>
```

`TxEvent` is divided in 4 different events:

```ts
type TxEvent = TxSigned | TxBroadcasted | TxBestBlocksState | TxFinalized
```

The first two are fairly straight-forward. Let's see them.

First of all, the transaction will be signed (exactly the same way as [`sign`](#sign)) and the event `TxSigned` will be emitted. As soon as the transaction gets signed, the transaction will be validated aganst the block specified in `txOptions` and, if it is valid, the transaction will be broadcasted and `TxBroadcasted` will be emitted then. If the transaction is invalid the observable will error with an [`InvalidTxError`](#invalidtxerror).

This two events can only be emitted once each:

```ts
type TxSigned = { type: "signed"; txHash: HexString }
type TxBroadcasted = { type: "broadcasted"; txHash: HexString }
```

Then, as soon as the block is found in a `bestBlock` or if the transaction is not valid in one of the best blocks the following event will be emitted:

```ts
type TxBestBlocksState = {
  type: "txBestBlocksState"
  txHash: HexString
} & (
  | {
      found: false
      isValid: boolean
    }
  | {
      found: true
      ok: boolean
      events: Array<SystemEvent["event"]>
      dispatchError?: DispatchError
      block: { hash: string; number: number; index: number }
    }
)
```

We can see that this is a 2-in-1 event. After the broadcast, the library will start verifying the state of the transaction against some best blocks in a smart way. Then, two main situations could happen:

- The transaction is not found in any block in the latest known `bestBlock` branch. If this is the case, `polkadot-api` will check if the transaction is still valid in the block. The event received in this case will be

```ts
interface TxBestBlockNotFound {
  type: "txBestBlocksState"
  txHash: HexString
  found: false
  isValid: boolean
}
```

- The transaction is found in a `bestBlock`. We already infer that the transaction is valid in this block (otherwise it wouldn't get inside it). Therefore, we align the payload to the finalized event, and the event received is as follows. See the finalized event for more info on the fields.

```ts
interface TxBestBlockFound {
  type: "txBestBlocksState"
  txHash: HexString
  found: true
  ok: boolean
  events: Array<SystemEvent["event"]>
  dispatchError?: DispatchError
  block: { hash: string; number: number; index: number }
}
```

This event will be emitted any number of times. It might happen that the tx is found in a best block, then this block gets pruned and is not anymore in the new best block branch, comes back, etc. We'll pass all that information to the consumer.

Here two things can happen. The first one is that the tx gets in a block that becomes finalized. In this case we will emit the following event once and will complete the subscription.

```ts
type TxFinalized = {
  type: "finalized"
  txHash: HexString
  ok: boolean
  events: Array<SystemEvent["event"]>
  dispatchError?: DispatchError
  block: { hash: string; number: number; index: number }
}
```

At this stage, the transaction is valid and already in the canonical chain, in a finalized block. We pass, besides the `txHash` as in the other events, the following stuff:

- `ok`: it tells if the extrinsic was successful in its purpose. Under the hood it basically checks that the event `System.ExtrinsicFailed` was not emitted.
- `events`: array of all events emitted by the extrinsic. They are ordered as emitted on-chain.
- `dispatchError`: in case the transaction failed, this will have the `dispatchError` value of `System.ExtrinsicFailed`. Read more about it in [`DispatchError`](#dispatcherror)
- `block`: information of the block where the `tx` is present. `hash` of the block, `number` of the block, `index` of the tx in the block.

On the other hand, if the transaction is invalid in any finalized block after the broadcasting the observable will error with an [`InvalidTxError`](#invalidtxerror).

### `InvalidTxError`

When a transaction is deemed as invalid (due to, for example, wrong nonce, expired mortality, not enough balance to pay the fees, etc) we provide a strongly typed error. It can be used as follows:

```ts
import { InvalidTxError, TransactionValidityError } from "polkadot-api"
import { myChain } from "@polkadot-api/descriptors"

tx.signAndSubmit(signer)
  .then(() => "tx went well")
  .catch((err) => {
    if (err instanceof InvalidTxError) {
      const typedErr: TransactionValidityError<typeof myChain> = err.error
      console.log(typedErr)
    }
  })

// it is available, of course, for observable-based broadcasting
tx.signSubmitAndWatch(signer).subscribe({
  error: (err) => {
    if (err instanceof InvalidTxError) {
      const typedErr: TransactionValidityError<typeof myChain> = err.error
      console.log(typedErr)
    }
  },
})
```

This `typedErr` will be, then, strongly typed as any other type coming from PAPI. Its content might differ per chain, but it enables the developer to get the information required and act accordingly.

:::info
This error will only be available for chains with Runtime Metadata `v15` or greater.

In case you are using the whitelist feature of the codegen, remember to add `"api.TaggedTransactionQueue.validate_transaction"` to the list of whitelisted interactions.

### `DispatchError`

In Polkadot, a transaction can be valid (and therefore not to throw the `InvalidError`) but the inner extrinsic fail. In this case, the event `ExtrinsicFailed` gives all the information required to understand why it failed. We also expose a `dispatchError` field that helps to guess why it failed. Better a picture than a thousand words:

```ts
// `Chain` will change depending on the name you gave the chain
// in the codegen
import { ChainDispatchError } from "@polkadot-api/descriptors"
tx.signSubmitAndWatch(signer).subscribe((ev) => {
  if (
    ev.type === "finalized" ||
    (ev.type === "txBestBlocksState" && ev.found)
  ) {
    // here we are sure that the transaction is in a block (whether finalized or bestBlock)
    // with `ok` we know the extrinsic failed
    if (!ev.ok) {
      const err: ChainDispatchError = ev.dispatchError
      // you will have a strongly typed object that you can keep narrowing down
      // to find the root of the issue
      if (err.type === "Module" && err.value.type === "Balances")
        "keep checking..."
    }
  }
})
```

:::info
In case you are using the whitelist feature of the codegen, remember to add `"event.System.ExtrinsicFailed"` to the list of whitelisted interactions.
