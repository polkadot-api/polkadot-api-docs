# Providers

The entry point of Polkadot-API, `createClient(provider)` requires one `JsonRpcProvider`, which lets Polkadot-API communicate with a node. It's a function with the following shape:

```ts
interface JsonRpcProvider {
    (onMessage: (message: string) => void) => JsonRpcConnection;
}

interface JsonRpcConnection {
    send: (message: string) => void;
    disconnect: () => void;
}
```

Calling it will initiate a connection. Messages coming from the service will come through the `onMessage` call, and the returned connection handle can be used to send messages or terminate the connection.

Polkadot-API offers a couple of providers for some of the most used ways of connecting to a chain:

- `WebSocketProvider(uri: string)` from `polkadot-api/ws-provider/web` or `polkadot-api/ws-provider/node` to connect through WebSocket.
- `getSmProvider(chain: smoldot.Chain)` from `polkadot-api/sm-provider` to connect through Smoldot.

The `JsonRpcProvider` interface is designed so that it can be easily enhanced: You can wrap any JsonRpcProvider with another one that adds in more features, such as logging, statistics, or error recovery.

## Logs provider

Polkadot-API has a subpackage `polkadot-api/logs-provider` that can be used to create a provider that will replay node messages from a log file (`logsProvider`), along with a provider enhancer that can be used to generate the logs consumed by `logsProvider`: `withLogsRecorder`.

```ts
// 1. recording logs
import { createClient } from "polkadot-api"
import { withLogsRecorder } from "polkadot-api/logs-provider"
import { WebSocketProvider } from "polkadot-api/ws-provider/node"

const wsProvider = WebSocketProvider("wss://example.url")
// Using console.log to output each line, but you could e.g. write it directly to a
// file or push into an array
const provider = withLogsRecorder((line) => console.log(line), wsProvider)
const client = createClient(provider)
```

```ts
// 2. replaying logs
import { createClient } from "polkadot-api"
import { logsProvider } from "polkadot-api/logs-provider"
import logs from "./readLogs"

const provider = logsProvider(logs)
const client = createClient(provider)
```

This can be useful to debug specific scenarios without needing to depend on an external source.
