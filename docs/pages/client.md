# PolkadotClient

`PolkadotClient` interface shapes the top-level API for `polkadot-api`. Once we get a client using `createClient` function, we'll find the following:

```ts
interface PolkadotClient {
  /**
   * Retrieve the ChainSpecData as it comes from the [JSON-RPC
   * spec](https://paritytech.github.io/json-rpc-interface-spec/api/chainSpec.html)
   */
  getChainSpecData: () => Promise<ChainSpecData>

  /**
   * Observable that emits `BlockInfo` for every new finalized block. It's a
   * multicast and stateful observable, that will synchronously replay its
   * latest known state.
   */
  finalizedBlock$: Observable<BlockInfo>
  /**
   * @returns Latest known finalized block.
   */
  getFinalizedBlock: () => Promise<BlockInfo>

  /**
   * Observable that emits an Array of `BlockInfo`, being the first element the
   * latest known best block, and the last element the latest known finalized
   * block. It's a multicast and stateful observable, that will synchronously
   * replay its latest known state. This array is an immutable data structure;
   * i.e. a new array is emitted at every event but the reference to its
   * children are stable if the children didn't change.
   *
   * Note that some blocks might not get reported, e.g. if they become finalized
   * immediately without being part of the best block chain.
   */
  bestBlocks$: Observable<BlockInfo[]>
  /**
   * @returns Array of `BlockInfo`, being the first element the latest
   *          known best block, and the last element the latest known
   *          finalized block.
   */
  getBestBlocks: () => Promise<BlockInfo[]>

  /**
   * Observable to watch Block Body.
   *
   * @param hash  It can be a block hash, `"finalized"`, or `"best"`
   * @returns Observable to watch a block body. There'll be just one event
   *          with the payload and the observable will complete.
   */
  watchBlockBody: (hash: string) => Observable<HexString[]>
  /**
   * Get Block Body (Promise-based)
   *
   * @param hash  It can be a block hash, `"finalized"`, or `"best"`
   * @returns Block body.
   */
  getBlockBody: (hash: string) => Promise<HexString[]>

  /**
   * Get Block Header (Promise-based)
   *
   * @param hash  It can be a block hash, `"finalized"` (default), or
   *              `"best"`
   * @returns Block hash.
   */
  getBlockHeader: (hash?: string) => Promise<BlockHeader>

  /**
   * Broadcasts a transaction (Promise-based). The promise will resolve when the
   * transaction is found in a finalized block; and will reject if the
   * transaction is invalid and can't be broadcasted, or if it is deemed invalid
   * later on.
   *
   * @param transaction  SCALE-encoded tx to broadcast.
   * @param at           It can be a block hash, `"finalized"`, or `"best"`.
   *                     That block will be used to verify the validity of
   *                     the tx.
   */
  submit: (
    transaction: HexString,
    at?: HexString,
  ) => Promise<TxFinalizedPayload>
  /**
   * Broadcasts a transaction and returns an Observable. The observable will
   * complete as soon as the transaction is in a finalized block. See
   * https://papi.how/typed/tx#signsubmitandwatch to learn about all possible
   * events.
   *
   * @param transaction  SCALE-encoded tx to broadcast.
   * @param at           It can be a block hash, `"finalized"`, or `"best"`.
   *                     That block will be used to verify the validity of
   *                     the tx.
   */
  submitAndWatch: (
    transaction: HexString,
    at?: HexString,
  ) => Observable<TxBroadcastEvent>

  /**
   * Returns an instance of a `TypedApi`.
   *
   * @param descriptors  Pass descriptors from `@polkadot-api/descriptors`
   *                     generated by `papi` CLI.
   */
  getTypedApi: <D extends ChainDefinition>(descriptors: D) => TypedApi<D>

  /**
   * Returns an instance of a `UnsafeApi`.
   *
   * Note that this method is only meant for advanced users that really know
   * what are they doing. This API does not provide any runtime compatibility
   * checks protection and the consumer should implement them on their own.
   */
  getUnsafeApi: <D>() => UnsafeApi<D>

  /**
   * This will `unfollow` the provider, disconnect and error every subscription.
   * After calling it nothing can be done with the client.
   */
  destroy: () => void

  /**
   * This API is meant as an "escape hatch" to allow access to debug endpoints
   * such as `system_version`, and other useful endpoints that are not spec
   * compliant.
   *
   * @example
   *
   *   const systemVersion = await client._request<string>("system_version", [])
   *   const myFancyThhing = await client._request<
   *     { value: string },
   *     [id: number]
   *   >("very_fancy", [1714])
   *
   */
  _request: <Reply = any, Params extends Array<any> = any[]>(
    method: string,
    params: Params,
  ) => Promise<Reply>
}
```

As one can note, `PolkadotClient` heavily relies on rxjs' `Observable`, used as well under the hood of Promise-based methods. Every method is fairly straight-forward and already documented exhaustively, except for `getTypedApi` and `getUnsafeApi`. We will see first of all the `TypedApi`, and afterwards the `UnsafeApi`.
