# TypedApi

The `TypedApi` allows to interact with the runtime metadata easily and with a great developer experience. It'll allow to make storage calls, create transactions, etc. It uses the descriptors generated by PAPI CLI (see [Codegen](/codegen) section for a deeper explanation) to generate the types used at devel time. `TypedApi` object looks like:

```ts
type TypedApi = {
  query: StorageApi
  tx: TxApi
  txFromCallData: TxFromBinary
  event: EvApi
  apis: RuntimeCallsApi
  constants: ConstApi
  compatibilityToken: Promise<CompatibilityToken>
}
```

Every field except for `compatibilityToken` and `txFromCallData` is a `Record<string, Record<string, ???>>`. The first index defines the pallet, and the second one defines which query/tx/event/api/constant within that pallet. Each one of them will be described in the following pages.

`txFromCallData` will be explained as well in the [`tx`](/typed/tx) section. Let's focus on the compatibility check, which is common for all of them.
