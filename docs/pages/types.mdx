# Types

All the types defined in the metadata of a chain are anonymous: They represent the structure of the data, down to the primitive types.

Polkadot-API has some types defined that make it easier working with chain data.

## SS58String

Binary values tagged as a accounts are abstracted as `SS58String`. The type `SS58String` exported by Polkadot-API is an alias of `string`, but it's indicative that the string that it expects is an SS58-formatted string. The value will be encoded to the public address in binary.

When PolkadotAPI receives an `SS58String` as a parameter, it can be in any valid format. But the `SS58String` returned from any of the methods will always be in the format declared by the chain's metadata.

```ts
const dotApi = client.getTypedApi(dot);

const [proxies, deposit] = await dotApi.query.Proxy.Proxies.getValue(
  // HDX format (for demo purposes that it accepts any SS58 string, regardless of the chain)
  "7LE64AxmGixNsxFs1rdsDkER5nuuQ28MbrSS7JtHwRmdcdam"
);

console.log(proxies[0].delegate);
// "12R1XCdgkHysv8Y4ntiXguo4eUYHXjQTmfRjL8FbmezsG71j", which is polkadot's format
```

## HexString

Another alias of `string`, but indicates that the value is a valid hexadecimal string. It accepts the string with or without the `0x` prefix, but `HexString` returned from methods always have `0x`.


## Enum

Enums in the chain are represented as `{ type: string, value: T }`. As many of the types have nested enums that would make it hard to work with (both creating these types and also reading them), Polkadot-API helps through a set of utilites.

First of all, the Enums that are widely used across multiple chains are in a directory of well-known types, and they are represented with a descriptive name. A few examples: `MultiAddress`, `BalanceStatus`, `IdentityJudgement`, and many of the XCM pallet types: `XcmV3Junction`, `XcmV3MultiassetFungibility`, etc.

For these types, you can import them directly from the generated code and use them by calling their type. The call signature shown by an IDE will tell you exactly which enum types you should use to write your value. The following video shows how it might look like:

<video src="enums.mp4" controls />

The enums that are not well-known types, they are anonymous. In that case, you will find something like the following in the call signature:

```ts
(value: IEnum<{
    transfer_allow_death: {
        dest: MultiAddress;
        value: bigint;
    };
    force_transfer: {
        dest: MultiAddress;
        value: bigint;
        source: MultiAddress;
    };
    ... 4 more ...;
    force_set_balance: {
        ...;
    };
}>) => PolkadotRuntimeRuntimeCall
```

This indicates that the parameter value is an enum, whose key will be either one of the keys of the object type (i.e. `transfer_allow_death`, `force_transfer`, ..., `force_set_balance`), and the type will be the value for that particular key.

For these cases, you should use the function `Enum(type, value)`, imported from `polkadot-api`. This has full type inference support, and creates an Enum object that can be used as a parameter of a call:

```ts
dotApi.apis.TransactionPaymentCallApi.query_call_info(
  PolkadotRuntimeRuntimeCall.Balances(
    Enum("transfer_allow_death", { dest: MultiAddress.Id(address), value: 3n })
  ),
  10
);
```

When reading from Enums, these are objects with `{ type: string, value: unknown }` with discriminated types based on the `type` (so if you do `switch (enum.type) {` you will have the correct value for the `type`).

## Binary

Any array of u8's is represented as Binary. This is a utility type that has a few functions to easily create binary data:

```ts
Binary.fromBytes(new Uint8Array())
Binary.fromHex("0b187a23c4f65d86c9a324b56f7e81aa")
const binary = Binary.fromText("Text that will be turned into binary")

binary.asBytes(); // Uint8Array
binary.asHex(); // "0x5465787420746861742077696c6c206265207475726e656420696e746f2062696e617279"
binary.asText(); // "Text that will be turned into binary"

```

## FixedSizeBinary&lt;L&gt;

Same as `Binary`, but when the chain metadata specifies a length. The length is shown as a type parameter, for reference.

## FixedSizeArray&lt;L, T&gt;

When the metadata has a type that's an array of a specific length, that's also shown as a `FixedSizeArray<L, T>`, which is a superset of `Array<T>`, except that it checks that the length must be `L`.

## Interface types

The types returned from any call are available through the top-level exports

```ts
import {
  dot,
  DotQueries,
  DotCalls,
  DotConstants,
  DotErrors,
  DotEvents,
} from "@polkadot-api/descriptors";

// Storage queries
function processAccount(account: DotQueries["System"]["Account"]["Value"]) {
  // ...
}
processAccount(await dotApi.query.System.Account.getValue("SS58Account"));

// Constants
function formatSS58Account(
  value: DotConstants["System"]["SS58Prefix"],
  account: Uint8Array
) {
  // ...
}
formatSS58Account(await dotApi.constants.System.SS58Prefix(), new Uint8Array());

// Transactions
function performTransfer(
  transfer: DotCalls["Balances"]["transfer_allow_death"]
) {
  return dotApi.tx.Balances.transfer_allow_death(transfer).signAndSubmit(
    signer
  );
}
performTransfer({
  dest: MultiAddress.Id("SS58Account"),
  value: 100n,
});

// Events
function reactToNewAccount(event: DotEvents['System']['NewAccount']) {
  // ...
}

// Errors
function logError(error: DotErrors['System']['InvalidSpecName']) {
  // ...
}
```
